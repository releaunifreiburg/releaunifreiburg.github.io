The Representation Learning Lab (RELEA) led by J.-Prof. Dr. Josif Grabocka was founded in 01.12.2019 and focuses on exploring Deep Learning representations to tackle diverse Machine Learning tasks arising in practical data-driven application domains. In particular, the lab is focused on AutoML, Neural Architecture Search, Hyperparameter Optimization, as well as designing end-to-end architectures for sequential data (time-series) and Recommender System prediction tasks.
